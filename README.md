Markov Chains for text generation

📝 Markov Chain-Based Text Generation
🚀 Overview
This project implements a text generation algorithm using Markov Chains, a statistical model that predicts the probability of a word based on its previous occurrences. The model is built using trigrams (three-word sequences) for improved contextual accuracy.

🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Preprocesses the input text by removing punctuation and converting words to lowercase.
2️⃣ Builds a trigram model, mapping word pairs to probable next words.
3️⃣ Uses probabilistic selection to generate realistic text sequences.

📜 Sample Output
"Chirped as the cool evening breeze rustled through the landscape."
